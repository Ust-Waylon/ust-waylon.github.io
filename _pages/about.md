Nice to meet you! I'm a first year PhD student in Computer Science and Engineering at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), supervised by [Prof. Raymond Chi-Wing WONG](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/~raywong/). I obtained a BSc degree in Data Science and Technology (DSCT) at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) in 2024.  
My research interests is about data mining and machine learning, more specifically, focusing on the field of Session-based Recommendation systems.
