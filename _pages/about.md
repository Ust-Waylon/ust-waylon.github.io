Nice to meet you! I'm a first year PhD student in Computer Science and Engineering at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). I obtained a BSc degree in Data Science and Technology (DSCT) at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST).

A data-driven personal website
======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, Academic Pages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.
