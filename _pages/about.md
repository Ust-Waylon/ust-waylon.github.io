Nice to meet you! I'm a second year PhD student in Computer Science and Engineering at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), supervised by [Prof. Raymond Chi-Wing WONG](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/~raywong/). I obtained a BSc degree in Data Science and Technology (DSCT) at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) in 2024.

Research Interests
======
My research interests are about data mining and machine learning, more specifically, focusing on the field of Session-based Recommendation systems. 
I'm also interested in exploring the potential of LLMs (Large Language Models) in the field of recommendation systems.
